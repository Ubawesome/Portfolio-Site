                    Hi! Having grown up in the Pacific Northwest of the USA, I have naturally become used to a diverse environment with people of varying backgrounds and identities.
                    I attended <abbr title="Lane Community College">LCC</abbr> immediately after high school, staying for three years and earning two AAS degrees, one in each of Computer Programming and Computer Simulation & Game Design.
                    During my time at LCC, I started an internship at Dark Matter Consulting, which then transitioned into regular contract work. For the past several years I have worked on many projects through Dark Matter, focused mainly on Microsoft's .NET stack, as well as some React Native and NodeJS.
